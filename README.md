# ec-encodings

This repository contains different implementations of Event Calculus for ASP.
Right now, there is encodings destined for `clingo` and `clingo-dl`. Other will follow.

## Missing feature of Event Calculus :
* Abnormality
* Trajectories
* Indirect consequences of actions

## List of implementations
* **Easy Event Calculus**: A version of EC without advanced features. Inspired by E. Mueller's Discrete Event Calculus.
* **Easy Event Calculus DL**: A variant using difference constraints. (TBD)
* **Easy Event Calculus with Durations**: A variant putting duration on actions. (TBD)
* **Calculus of event**: An implementation inspired from the initial works of Kowalsky, using clingo-dl.
* **Calculus of event with durations**: A variant putting duration on actions.
