# ec-encodings

This repository contains different implementations of Event Calculus for ASP.
Right now, there is encodings destined for `clingo` and `clingo-dl`. Other will follow.

## Missing feature of Event Calculus :
* Abnormality
* Trajectories
* Indirect consequences of actions

## List of implementations
* **Easy Event Calculus**: A version of EC without advanced features. Inspired by E. Mueller's Discrete Event Calculus and Kim/Lee/Pala translation into SM.
* **Easy Event Calculus with Durations**: An extending of the previous encoding putting duration on actions.

## List of future implementations
* Durations inspired by other works from the litterature
